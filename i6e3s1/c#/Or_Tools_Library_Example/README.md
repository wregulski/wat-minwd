```
dotnet run --project Minwd.BasicConsoleApplication
```

*There should be no worries to try compile it on Linux machine*

## Linear problem which it's solving: 

```
/// This function is solving example of the basic linear optimalization task.
/// We are using Or-Tools Library to find the answer.
/// Example: 
/// Maximize -> 4x1 + 2x2
/// While: 
/// 1 <= x1 <= 3
/// 0 <= x2 <= 6
/// 2x1 + x2 <= 5
```
